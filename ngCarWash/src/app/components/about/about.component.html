            <h2>Our Coding Experience</h2>

            <p>We had an incredible experience working together on the Skill Distillery project. Throughout the development process, we delved into various technologies, including JPA for efficient data persistence, Spring Controllers and Services for robust backend functionality, and Angular components, models, and routes to create a dynamic and responsive frontend.</p>

            <p>Collaborating on this project was not just about coding; it was also about learning and growing together. We faced challenges head-on, celebrated successes, and had fun exploring the intricacies of software development. The journey of implementing complex features and seamlessly displaying data to the frontend was both challenging and rewarding.</p>

            <p>As a team, we are proud of what we've accomplished and look forward to applying the skills and knowledge gained from this project to future endeavors.</p>
