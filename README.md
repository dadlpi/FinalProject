## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project was to simulate a business application for business users and customers, specifically tracking customers and their vehicles in a car wash business.

## Description

This full-stack application was a collaborative effort between Diego De La Puente, Nurdoolot Aitaliev, and David Taylor. Each contributor played a crucial role in the development process.

## Technologies Used

- **MySQL Database:** Used for storing and managing data related to customers and vehicles.
- **JPA (Java Persistence API):** Utilized for interacting with the database through repositories.
- **Spring Service Layer:** Implemented to communicate with the repository, encapsulating business logic.
- **Spring HTTP Request Routing Controller:** Used for routing HTTP requests and managing endpoints.
- **Spring Security:** Implemented to ensure proper authentication for API RESTful services.
- **Angular:** Employed for building the front-end portion of the application, including components, models, services, and routing.
- **Bootstrap CSS:** Used to enhance the visual appeal and responsiveness of the front-end.

## Contributors

- **Diego De La Puente:** Scrum Master and contributor to the project. Played a key role in implementing server-side logic, ensuring proper authentication for API RESTful services.

- **Nurdoolot Aitaliev:** Database Administrator (DBA) responsible for the design and maintenance of the MySQL database.

- **David Taylor:** Repo Owner and contributor, actively involved in developing the Spring Service layer and HTTP request routing controller.

## Lessons Learned

The development of this project presented several challenges, including designing proper server-side logic on the Java code to restrict API RESTful services only to properly authenticated users. Implementing this logic required thoughtful consideration and collaboration among the team members.
